> Here you should include the process and product of your 4th activity: **Forming**

| Title     | Forming (process): Form (product)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Objective | Document the process and products and provide explanations to ensure reusability of materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Procedure | Finalize the plans and the forms of all functional units. Optionally, choose a way to alter the jaggedness of voxels in the final form by partially bringing in contrasting curvy shapes, for instance as a shell around the building, e.g. through smoothing, relaxation, iso-surfaces, or topological transformation. |
