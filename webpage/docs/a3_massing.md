| Objective | Logically place the functional spaces in between bridges within the building envelope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Procedure | Compute a Solar Envelope, i.e. an envelope of cuboids/voxels, some of which are removed because they are in the way of the neighbouring buildings receiving some standard/minimum level of direct sunlight. Fit the circulation manifold into the solar envelope. From the standing platforms corresponding to functional spaces, grow them into voxel clouds within your voxelated envelope. Colour the voxel clouds according to their functionalities. |
