And what happens with a number 2/3? If you truncate that number after that many decimals, what will the last number be: a 6 or are we going to round it up to 7? If we use symbolic notation there is no issue of course but computers can't do that.\n",

It returns an element from a certain index and at the same time deletes it from the list.<br>\n",
