    "We start the Python programming workshop with some very simple examples on how to use Python, mainly to introduce some of the concepts of programming in general (aka the *lingo* - the special vocabulary of a particular field of interest, which is, in this case, Python). Computers are very good at calculating things. They can do this with amazing speeds: your laptop can do around 83.000.000.000 calculations in a single second! So the examples below are a bit of an insult to the power of the computer (and probably your intellect as well).\n",

    "In the second cell we first *assign* the *value* (or data) to a *variable*. The value **4** gets *assigned* to a *variable* with the name **x**. The equal sign (**=**) is the *assignment operator*. The assignment operator creates a link between a name (variable) and a value (data). The complete first line in the cell above is a *statement*. It is executed from right to left. First the expression *4 * 2* is evaluated, resulting in 8. This result is then assigned to the *variable* **a** with the assignment operator. By assigning data to named variables we can reuse them later in our code (much like the MR key on your calculator).\n",

The text after the # (hash) sign is blue/green (?) and in italics. This line is not executed when you run the code, it is a comment. Try removing the hash and re-run the cell and see what happens. Comments are useful to explain what the code does. If you write a program it is good practice to add some comments here and there in case you revisit your code weeks or months later.\n",
    "#### Builtin Functions\n",
    "The **print** function is part of the Python programming language. In the early days of programming you had to program litterlay everything to get a result. You had to write your own code to print something to a screen or to a printer. People got bored of doing this every time they had to write a program so they started to make libraries with some predifened functions. Python already has a lot of libraries included and many more can be downloaded, or better yet, easily installed through some programs included with Python, from the [Pypi website](https://pypi.org/). On this [webpage](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) you can find all the default Python libraries. In the examples below we will make use of some of those libraries, so don't worry if you are overwhelmed by the number and explanation of the use of these libraries on those webpages.\n",

In Python you have to put characters between single or double quotes ('  or \"), else Python will think you are using a variable.
